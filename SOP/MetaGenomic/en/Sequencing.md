## Biological samples
Collect the fecal sample using the sampling spoon and spatula of the fecal collection kit (NBG-4, Noble Biosciences), shake well to homogenize the sample, and store at -80℃.


## DNA preparation for short reads sequencing
### Reagents  
**FastDNA SPIN Kit for Feces (MP Biomedicals)**  
- Sodium Phosphate Buffer (MP Biomedicals), MT Buffer (MP Biomedicals), PLS Solution (MP Biomedicals), PPS Solution (MP Biomedicals), Wash Buffer #1(MP Biomedicals), Wash Buffer #2 (MP Biomedicals), TES (MP Biomedicals), 100% ethanol

### DNA extraction  
- Transfer 500 mg of the fecal sample onto ice into a lysing matrix E tube using a sterilized spatula in a fume hood.
- Add 825 μl of sodium phosphate buffer and 825 μl of PLS solution. Close the lid, and vortex for 10-15 seconds to loosen the sample in the tube.
- Centrifuge the sample at 14,000×g for 5 minutes and discard the supernatant.
- Add 978 μl of sodium phosphate buffer and 122 μl of MT buffer. Vortex again until the sample is resuspended.
- Homogenize the sample by vortexing at 6.0 m/s for 40 seconds using a beadbeater, such as the FastPrep 24 instrument. If it appears that there was insufficient homogenization due to large debris, perform additional homogenization under the same conditions for all samples, but with careful intervals and attention to the heat generated by the vibration.
- Centrifuge the sample at 14,000×g for 5 minutes and transfer the supernatant to a 2 ml tube.
- Add 250 μl of PPS solution. Invert slowly (do not vortex) and keep at 4°C for 10 minutes, then centrifuge at 14,000×g for 2 minutes.
- Transfer 1 ml of the binding matrix solution to a 15 ml conical tube during centrifugation.
- Transfer the supernatant from the centrifuged sample to the 15 ml tube containing the binding matrix solution. Invert.
- Place the tube in the shaking incubator at an angle that allows the sample to mix well and let it sit for 3-5 minutes.
- Centrifuge at 14,000×g for 2 minutes and discard the supernatant.
- Add 1 ml of wash buffer #1 and gently resuspend the pellet.
- Transfer 600 μl of the binding matrix and wash buffer #1 mixture to a SPIN filter tube. Centrifuge at 14,000×g for 1 minute, empty the catch tube, transfer the remaining solution, and centrifuge again. Empty the catch tube once more.
- Add 500 μl of wash buffer #2 (ethanol added) to the SPIN filter tube and gently pipette to resuspend (do not vortex).
- Centrifuge at 14,000×g for 2 minutes and empty the catch tube.
- Centrifuge again at 14,000×g for 2 minutes to remove any remaining wash buffer and dry the pellet.
- Transfer the SPIN filter bucket to a new 1.9 ml catch tube and add 60-100 μl of TES solution. Gently tap the tube using your fingertips to mix the pellet with the solution. (Do not vortex)
- Centrifuge at 14,000×g for 2 minutes to elute the DNA from the pellet.
- Quantify using a NanoDrop and store the eluted DNA frozen at -20°C.


## DNA preparation for long reads seqencing
### Reagents
**QIAamp PowerFecal DNA kit (Qiagen)**  
We employed the QIAamp PowerFecal DNA kit (Qiagen), as recommended by PacBio. This choice was made because long-read sequencing demands a substantial amount of DNA, and it is crucial to minimize DNA fragmentation.

### DNA extraction
DNA extraction from feces was performed following the protocol of the kit manufacturer.
